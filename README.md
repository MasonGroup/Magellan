## Overview
The **Magellan Virus** is a mysterious and terrifying piece of software designed to demonstrate the power of creative programming and how it can interact with a system in unexpected ways. With its creepy effects and chaotic behavior, this virus serves as a warning of what software could achieve if placed in the wrong hands. 🌀⚔️

## Features
- **Screen Effects:** Distorts the screen with randomized colors and glitches, creating a visually unsettling experience. 🔮
- **Icon Chaos:** Draws random icons on the desktop, making it look like your system is possessed. 🔧⚠
- **Cursor Madness:** Randomly moves the cursor to unpredictable locations, making it impossible to control. 🎨❄️
- **Disturbing Sounds:** Generates and plays looping bytebeat audio to add an eerie ambiance. 🎵☠
- **MBR Manipulation:** Modifies the Master Boot Record (MBR) to create persistent and destructive effects. 💾⚡
- **Rootkit Integration:** Hides its presence in processes and paths, making it extremely difficult to detect. 🛡️🕵️
- **UAC Bypass:** Elevates privileges silently, bypassing User Account Control (UAC) prompts. 🔓⚙️

## How It Works
The Magellan Virus uses advanced Windows API calls to:
- Manipulate the desktop window and draw graphical elements.
- Randomly move the cursor across the screen.
- Generate and play synthesized sound effects continuously.

### Key Components
- **Visual Distortion:** Uses GDI functions to apply glitches and color effects.
- **Icon Drawing:** Spams warning and error icons on the desktop.
- **Cursor Movement:** Randomly sets cursor positions with high frequency.
- **Audio Generation:** Synthesizes audio using mathematical formulas.

## Warning
**Do not execute this program unless you fully understand its impact.**
- It can make your system unresponsive.
- It might require a manual restart to regain control.
- Improper usage can result in data loss or system corruption. 🔥⛔
